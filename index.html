        <h3>Trafficking</h3>
        <p>This is what people do with pangolins/their parts.</p>

          <li>Eat them.</li>
          <li>Harvest their scales.</li>
          <li>Make pangolin wine.</li>

         <h4>How to help</h4>
         <p>Because pangolins live in Asia and Africa, it's easy to feel that there's nothing you can do to help. However, knowledge is power,
           so feel free to study up on pangolins and let others know about their plight.</p>
